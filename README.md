# Fault_Detection
Fault_Detection_in_microgrid
Abstract:
The project's primary objective is the development of a MATLAB/Simulink program tailored for fault detection
within a small-scale microgrid, essential for establishing resilient and sustainable smart cities. The microgrid model
encompasses three distinct fault typesâ€”three-phase faults at the main grid, partial shading affecting the solar
panel, and tripping faults occurring at the main breaker of a microgrid house.

The key project objectives are outlined as follows:

1.Automatic Fault Detection: Create a program with the capability to automatically detect faults, considering
diverse timings and magnitudes of occurrences.
2.Fault Classification: Implement a systematic approach for the automatic classification of identified faults,
distinguishing between three-phase faults, partial shading, and tripping faults.
3.Effective Noise Removal: Integrate noise removal techniques, including wavelet and FFT, to augment the
precision of fault detection.
